# BotBuilder
This creates a base layout for a discord bot and cogs for that bot. I needed a quicker way to create frames for my new project I'm gonna be working on and didn't feel like copy-pasting a lot so I just made this in 20 minutes to accomplish that small task.


To use this application you can type:

    ./botbuilder -h

to display a list of options.

Current implemented options are as follows:

./botbuilder -b
    Creates a barebones bot frame that allows for cog usage.

./botbuilder -c {filename}
    Creates a barebones cog with name {filename}. This will also auto-fill the cog to be loaded upon running the bot.
    If the bot is already running, then you must load the cog yourself. Else just run the program and it will load.
