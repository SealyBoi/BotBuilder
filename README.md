# BotBuilder
This creates a base layout for a discord bot and cogs for that bot. I needed a quicker way to create frames for my new project I'm gonna be working on and didn't feel like copy-pasting a lot so I just made this in 20 minutes to accomplish that small task.


To use this application you can type:

    ./botbuilder -h

to display a list of options.

Current implemented options are as follows:

./botbuilder -b
    Creates a barebones bot frame that allows for cog usage

./botbuilder -c {filename}
    Creates a barebones cog with name {filename}
